[u]Massive Success.[/u]
uppermanagement@green.space

We would like to extend our second-[b]highest congratulations[/b] to the [b]Future-Focused Innovation Department[/b] on their [n]new innovative project rollout[/n] in Northern Canada. This new project will innovate paradigms like few others in the region or industry. 

If you see a member of this team around your office: ask for their [b]consent[/b] first, then give them a [b]firm handshake[/b] and an [b]unblinking smile[/b], giving them [b]positive feedback[/b] for their hard work. This will [b]reinforce[/b] that they are doing the right thing, and [b]encourage them[/b] to continue acting in a [b]similar manner[/b] in the future.

Thank you all for your cooperation.

Try to reach their level, or at least your quotas,
Upper Management
