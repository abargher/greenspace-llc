Hi! 

I was gonna say it’s great to see you, but… I haven’t seen you yet. So it’s great to be sharing the same air! It’s been too long. Sorry I can’t come talk to you right now, I’m trying to hit my quota. When aren’t we, right? 

Hey, you know what? Let’s meet up at the water cooler for a chat later! I’ve got so much to tell you, last month was a movie haha. Keep on operating your symmetries or whatever!

[u]Official Correspondence from Prince Woraso of Lithuania [/u]
princewosrarsa@lithu.aniangovernment

Hello Kind friend ,

as you surely know, I recently inherited my father money of [b]$200 dollars million US Dollars[/b]. But, rather than waste it on un needed things like statues, mansions or social media paltform, I want to build a better world for my children. I love the children.

This is why I am investing all my money into Web3. My new crypto coin, WorasoCoin, is backed by Lithuanian government (most stable government in world), and will soon be worth at least $400,000,000 million US dollar.s This makes it best coin in the world. This is an investment you should not miss! Thank you aGain! Let me know if you are interest.

Surely we will be are best of friends!
I look forward to ou r grand friendship ,

As our projects get bigger, we will be redesigning and reimagining our…
[ul] Workflow

[u]Hey friend…[/u]
youknowitsalbert@green.space

Hey man,

I’ve gotta be honest with you, quotas have been a real struggle for me recently. But when haven’t they, right? I’m sorry, I’ll stop deflecting. It turns out they’ve been [i]too[/i] much of a struggle though, because the boys upstairs… they axed me… and yesterday was my last day. I didn’t have the heart to tell you in person, I couldn’t stand to see your face. I’m sorry I haven’t been the best friend, but, I hope I’ve been good enough to you. I hope you can forgive me.

Thank you for the stories, for the years of smiles you’ve brought to me. Maybe it never seemed like much to you, you’ve always been amazing that way. I hate to be such a sap but you really have meant a lot to me. Hopefully I’ll see you again? 

… Hopefully I’ll see you again.

I’m sorry,
Albert

We would like to extend our second-[b]highest congratulations[/b] to the [b]Future-Focused Innovation Department[/b] on their [n]new innovative project rollout[/n] in Northern Canada. This new project will innovate paradigms like few others in the region or industry. 

If you see a member of this team around your office: ask for their [b]consent[/b] first, then give them a [b]firm handshake[/b] and an [b]unblinking smile[/b], giving them [b]positive feedback[/b] for their hard work. This will [b]reinforce[/b] that they are doing the right thing, and [b]encourage them[/b] to continue acting in a [b]similar manner[/b] in the future.

Thank you all for your cooperation.

It seems you can’t [b]ESCAPE[/b] discourse about Gorilla Pills nowadays. A lot of people are taking the pills and unquestioningly (and unquestionably!) changing their lives for the better, for the [i]forever[/i], but some other people are more skeptical.

“How do they work? Are they safe? What if my ex-wife finds out? Are they legal? Will I need to confess I took these next Sunday?

Hello employee of this company whom I have much respect for and a lot of respect,

It is your CEO, your company’s boss. I have recently entered financial troubles, despite success of our great and successful company. This is because I refuse to take funds from company, to ensure its success, even when I need funds. It is through my honor and gratitude that I have entered this plight and come to you. 

I must save face to help our great company, and the board cannot know of this financial trouble I have recently entered and experienced and become engaged in. But you can help! If you can send 10 gift cards ($15 each) to –ADDRESS– then our great company can be even more successful.

Hello, everyone. As you all know, Green Space is a [b]growth mindset[/b] company.

This is [b]great news[/b] for all involved, and we could not be more excited for [b]you[/b] to do the work to build the [b]next generation of innovative paradigm shifting resiliency dynamics.[/b]

Hello [b]privileged and esteemed[/b] employees,

Today’s actualization authorization is especially important. The new government subsidies that were authorized for OBG have allowed us to expand our vision even further. Following this, we’ve identified myriad land areas as key targets for redevelopment to synergize our values with the community. Please make sure to authorize these with:
[ul]Pomp
 Circumstance
 Verve
 Panache [/ul]
To ensure strategic coordination for our integration of our core competencies with our values-based objectives.

I got an email from [i]the Upper Management[/i]. The Upper Management!! I got so giddy I knocked over my paper cup and had to head back over to the water cooler! Thankfully there was nobody there to notice my embarrassing mistake. The Management liked my potential optimization grids so much, they showed me exactly how they wanted me to do these next ones!
