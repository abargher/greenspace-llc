Dear [b]valued[/b] employee,

With our [b]quadrupling[/b] down on Green Space, it naturally follows we need an [b]octupling[/b] down on actualization optimization. To that end, please 
[ul]organize
 the new paradigm of [b]grid[/b]-
 based [b]redesignation potentiality[/b], for further 
 [b]actualization[/b] at a future date. [/ul]

This should be done expediently, expeditiously, expressly, and with synergy.
A
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
