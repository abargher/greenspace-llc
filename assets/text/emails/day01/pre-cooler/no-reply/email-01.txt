Hi! 

I was gonna say it’s great to see you, but… I haven’t seen you yet. So it’s great to be sharing the same air! It’s been too long. Sorry I can’t come talk to you right now, I’m trying to hit my quota. When aren’t we, right? 

Hey, you know what? Let’s meet up at the water cooler for a chat later! I’ve got so much to tell you, last month was a movie haha. Keep on operating your symmetries or whatever!

Happy new year,
Albert
