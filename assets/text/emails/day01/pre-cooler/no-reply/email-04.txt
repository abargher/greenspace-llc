princewosrarsa@lithu.aniangovernment

Hello Kind friend ,

as you surely know, I recently inherited my father money of [b]$200 dollars million US Dollars[/b]. But, rather than waste it on un needed things like statues, mansions or social media paltform, I want to build a better world for my children. I love the children.

This is why I am investing all my money into Web3. My new crypto coin, WorasoCoin, is backed by Lithuanian government (most stable government in world), and will soon be worth at least $400,000,000 million US dollar.s This makes it best coin in the world. This is an investment you should not miss! Thank you aGain! Let me know if you are interest.

Surely we will be are best of friends!
I look forward to ou r grand friendship ,
Prince Woraso
