[u]Hey friend…[/u]

Hey man,

I’ve gotta be honest with you, quotas have been a real struggle for me recently. But when haven’t they, right? I’m sorry, I’ll stop deflecting. It turns out they’ve been [i]too[/i] much of a struggle though, because the boys upstairs… they axed me… and yesterday was my last day. I didn’t have the heart to tell you in person, I couldn’t stand to see your face. I’m sorry I haven’t been the best friend, but, I hope I’ve been good enough to you. I hope you can forgive me.

Thank you for the stories, for the years of smiles you’ve brought to me. Maybe it never seemed like much to you, you’ve always been amazing that way. I hate to be such a sap but you really have meant a lot to me. Hopefully I’ll see you again? 

… Hopefully I’ll see you again.

I’m sorry,
Albert
