Hello valued employees! We are gearing up for an exciting new year at Green Space. Last year, we did a great job as a company in terms of our [b]unity, values and commitments to our mission statement[/b]. This year, though, we plan on really [b] operationalizing our core competencies [/b] to ensure

[ul] forward-thinking [b]risk management[/b]
[b]shareholder value.[/b] 
A [b]win-win-win[/b] for everyone![/ul]

To all our returning employees, let’s make this year even better than the last. Keep your [b]ducks[/b] in a [b]row[/b] and [b]touch base.[/b]

And please, keep your breaks short – there’s a lot to do!

Signed,
Upper Management
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
