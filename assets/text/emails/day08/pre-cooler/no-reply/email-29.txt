Hi boss!

Marvin here, if you didn’t remember. It’s fine if you didn’t! [b]Names are so hard[/b] and I’m sure you’re getting a [b]million emails[/b] a day from people just like me! I’ll stop wasting your important time, though! 

I got an email from [i]the Upper Management[/i]. The Upper Management!! I got so giddy I knocked over my paper cup and had to head back over to the water cooler! Thankfully there was nobody there to notice my embarrassing mistake. The Management liked my potential optimization grids so much, they showed me exactly how they wanted me to do these next ones! I’m just letting you know so that when they look amazing, you don’t think I cheated! 

Have a great, synergistic, efficient, [b]and[/b] optimized day!
Marvin
