Dear [b]valued[/b] employee,

Optimization should never come at the cost of efficiency or synergy. This has been a motto of Green Space for as long as Upper Management has allowed mottos for [b]dogmatic, collective effervescence.[/b]

Your work today should reflect that. Treat it like [b]a science, like an art, like a scientific art, and an artistic science[/b]. Treat it [b]like your loved ones[/b], but [b]not too loved[/b]. Not too loved.

J
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
