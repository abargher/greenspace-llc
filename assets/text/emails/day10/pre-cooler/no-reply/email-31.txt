Hi boss! Sorry for not emailing recently, but I’ve had to start the process of moving since I was evicted from my apartment. [b]The details aren’t important, it’s a whole thing. Just don’t worry about me!As long as I still have my job, nothing can get me down![/b]

Thankfully, I’ve got plenty of optimization potentials [b]for you to actualize today[/b]! I wonder how it feels to actualize. I bet it feels really official. Hopefully that can be me someday!

Thank you for being the best boss!
Marvin
