Hello employee of this company whom I have much respect for and a lot of respect,

It is your CEO, your company’s boss. I have recently entered financial troubles, despite success of our great and successful company. This is because I refuse to take funds from company, to ensure its success, even when I need funds. It is through my honor and gratitude that I have entered this plight and come to you. 

I must save face to help our great company, and the board cannot know of this financial trouble I have recently entered and experienced and become engaged in. But you can help! If you can send 10 gift cards ($15 each) to –ADDRESS– then our great company can be even more successful.

Thank you for your cooperation,
CEO
