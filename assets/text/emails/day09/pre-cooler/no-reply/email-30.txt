The amount of Green Space we’re able to develop is staggering lawmaker’s highest hopes. If we keep it up, we may be able to engage even more avenues for funding and expansion. [b]Keep authorizing, and the Green… [i]and[/i] the Green Space will keep flowing![/b]

Thank you all for the outstanding success of Operation Big Green,
