Hello [b]privileged and esteemed[/b] employees,

Today’s actualization authorization is especially important. The new government subsidies that were authorized for OBG have allowed us to expand our vision even further. Following this, we’ve identified myriad land areas as key targets for redevelopment to synergize our values with the community. Please make sure to authorize these with:
[ul]Pomp
 Circumstance
 Verve
 Panache [/ul]
To ensure strategic coordination for our integration of our core competencies with our values-based objectives. 

Thank you all for the continued success of Operation Big Green,
Upper Management
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
