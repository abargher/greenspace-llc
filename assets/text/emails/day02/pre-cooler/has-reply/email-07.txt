Dear [b]valued[/b] employee,

We donâ€™t take our pivots for granted at Green Space. [i]Never have, never will[/i]. As a [b]valued employee,[/b] you know this next part very well. Instead, we like to [b]reflect[/b] on our pivots (both the pivot towards the past and back towards the endless possibilities of the future). To this end, please prepare a quarterly report on your quarterly report on the previous quarter. For guidance:

[ul]Sixteen slides, [b]but only a thirty-secondth per slide[/b] (No more will be tolerated)
 [i]No[/i] speculatives
 Ensure [b]resilient solutions[/b] to [b]innovative dimensions[/b] [/ul]

Appreciated.

Appreciated,
U
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
