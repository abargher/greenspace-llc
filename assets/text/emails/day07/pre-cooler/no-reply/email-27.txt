Hi boss!

My name is Marvin, and I’m [b]so excited to work[/b] for you so I just wanted to introduce myself. I [b]love[/b] working with Green Space, and doing work for the community! I have Green Space’s core competencies as a poster on my wall, and in my bathroom so I can make sure I’m studying and staying up to date even when most people are “off the clock!” 

I hope my [b]mapping of optimization potentials for actualization is worth authorizing.[/b] I’m doing my best!

I hope I made a great impression, and I hope you have a greater, [b]synergistic[/b] day!

I love Operation Big Green!
Marvin
