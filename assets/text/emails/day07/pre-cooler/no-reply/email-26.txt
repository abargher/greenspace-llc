Hello [b]privileged and esteemed[/b] employees,

As Operation Big Green rolls ahead, we wanted to take this moment to reflect on how far weâ€™ve come. In terms of: 

[ul][b]reimagining[/b] our community
 Redevelopment
 Paradigm-shifting new strategies for [b]energy resiliency[/b]
 [b]Imagining[/b] our community in a [b]new light[/b][/ul]

OBG has been a massive success. None of this would have been possible without your [b]actualization of optimization potential[/b]. Keep on actualizing!

Thank you all,
Upper Management
[i]At Green Space, we make the world a Better Place![/i]
